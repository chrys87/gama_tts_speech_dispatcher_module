- Requirements:

  - A C++ compiler with C++11 support.
    The following compiler has been tested:
    - GCC 4.8.2 (GNU/Linux x86_64).

  - Gnuspeech-SA.

  - PortAudio with C++ binding (tested with version v19_20140130).

  - Speech Dispatcher (tested with version 0.8.1).

- Build Gnuspeech-SA, with source directory at ../gnuspeech_sa and
  build directory at ../gnuspeech_sa-build.

- Build (GNU/Linux):

  mkdir ../sd_gnuspeech-build
  cd ../sd_gnuspeech-build
  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../sd_gnuspeech
  make

- Set the absolute path of the configuration directory
  in conf/gnuspeech.conf.

- Add the following line to ~/.config/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf
  or /etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf:

  AddModule "gnuspeech" "<absolute_path_to>/sd_gnuspeech" "<absolute_path_to>/gnuspeech.conf"

  (
    - Fill <absolute_path_to>.
    - Don't forget to uncomment the line:
        AddModule "dummy"         "sd_dummy"      ""
  )
